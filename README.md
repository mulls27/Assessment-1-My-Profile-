# About me

Hi, my name is Kristian Muller, I am an Australian citizen of Irish and Swedish heritage. My education to date has been basic, having only completed my SACE as well as a Certificate III in Sports and Recreation. Something interesting about me is that I’m very tall. I stand at two hundred centimetres. My favourite hobby is playing football on the weekends and going to the driving range to smack a couple of golf balls.

# Interest in IT

## What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My interest in IT is functional; it is in a variety of software and hardware that can make the supply chain increasingly efficient for businesses to manage. I have always had an interest in IT, but recently this has developed into a specific interest in software that contributes to supply chain management effectiveness for firms like  WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new interest has come about since the warehouse I work in part time has moved from using paper-based inventory control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart from using the basics in the Microsoft suite and beginning to use RF scanners at work to control inventory. However, I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

# Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT as it was the only university at the time that offered an online degree in business and logistics. I have worked in logistics since leaving school 5 years ago. RMIT online appealed to me, as I’m able to juggle working part time and studying full time.

# What do you expect to learn during your studies?

During this semester, in Introduction to Information Technology, I expect to learn the foundational aspects of using information technologies and to gain information about new, contemporary soft- and hard-ware.
