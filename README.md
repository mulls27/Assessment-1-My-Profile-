# About me

Hi, my name is Kristian Muller, I am an Australian citizen of Irish and Swedish heritage. My education to date has been basic, having only completed my SACE as well as a Certificate III in Sports and Recreation. Something interesting about me is that I’m very tall. I stand at two hundred centimetres. My favourite hobby is playing football on the weekends and going to the driving range to smack a couple of golf balls.

# Interest in IT

## What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My interest in IT is functional; it is in a variety of software and hardware that can make the supply chain increasingly efficient for businesses to manage. I have always had an interest in IT, but recently this has developed into a specific interest in software that contributes to supply chain management effectiveness for firms like  WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new interest has come about since the warehouse I work in part time has moved from using paper-based inventory control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart from using the basics in the Microsoft suite and beginning to use RF scanners at work to control inventory. However, I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

# Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT as it was the only university at the time that offered an online degree in business and logistics. I have worked in logistics since leaving school 5 years ago. RMIT online appealed to me, as I’m able to juggle working part time and studying full time.

# What do you expect to learn during your studies?

During this semester, in Introduction to Information Technology, I expect to learn the foundational aspects of using information technologies and to gain information about new, contemporary soft- and hard-ware.

# A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.

The primary role of this job is to help staff and students with any IT queries they may have. Another role of this job is to help maintain and improve current services that the Department of Information Technology provide to the University. I find this position appealing, as I like being given a problem to solve and fix it. I also enjoying helping people. 

# A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.

To be competitive to gain this job, you will need a diploma level qualification in Information Technology,  or an equivalent level of knowledge gained through on the job training and experience, or a mixture of both. As this job is service oriented - supporting students and staff most of the time -previous experience in dealing with customers would be a good advantage, as this demonstrates the ability to provide customer service.  As well, being able to show previous problem-solving skills will be an advantage, as this job will be heavily based on people bringing you IT problems to be solved.

# A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.

I don’t have the IT certifications required to fill this position, however having worked in logistics dealing with problem solving for customers all day;  I would be able to satisfy the customer service component as well as the problem-solving component. Working in logistics requires problem solving someone’s freight/ supply chain problems all day. I do have some practical experience in using programs specific to logistics and believe I could, with training, acquire skills on the job.

# A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.

To become competitive to gain this job, I think the most important thing I could do is to start a Diploma of Information Technology. I would begin this process by enrolling in ICT50118 (Diploma of Information Technology) at TAFE. I would choose this Diploma as it is nationally recognised by the Australian Institute of ICT. Also, this Diploma is available to study online which would give me flexibility with work. I would also try and gain an entry level part-time job in the Information Technology sector. I believe a mixture of the study and on the job training and experience will hold me in good contention to be considered for hiring by Charles Sturt University as their Information Technology Support Officer.

# What do the results of these tests mean for you?

## 1  Myers-Briggs Test 

My ISFP-A result shows that this personality is sensitive to others therefore I easily relate to others. According to the test I am imaginative and passionate. However, the proposed weakness of this personality type is that they are fiercely independent and unpredictable, as well as  easily stressed; these are personality traits that I can relate to.

## 2	Learning Style Test

My result from my learning style test shows that I’m an auditory learner, this means I learn best by listening and speaking.  

## 3 Big Five Personality Test

The results of my Big Five Personality Test are very balanced with no trait over 67% and none being under 44% . O represents your Openness to experience, in which I scored 67%. Having a high score means your open to inventiveness and intellectual curiosity, preferring variety over routine, and seeking fulfillment in intense, euphoric experiences. Having a low score correlates with consistency and caution, seeking fulfillment in perseverance, tending to be pragmatic and data-driven (Stubblebine 2016). Having a score of 67% I believe I’m open to new experience, but don’t prioritise it as something to achieve in my life. 
C refers to Conscientiousness. People with high scores have  a tendency to be efficient and organised. They also tend to be self-disciplined and dependable. However, people with low scores are easy-going and possibly careless, as well as, flexible and spontaneous. They can be perceived as unreliable, having scored 44% in this area shows that I have some easy-going careless tendencies, however these traits are not strong (Stubblebine 2016). 
E refers to the trait Extraversion those with a high score have a tendency towards being outgoing and energetic. They are assertive, talkative, positive and a tendency to seek the company of others. High extraversion can be perceived as attention-seeking and domineering. However, those with a low score have: a tendency towards being solitary and reserved. Often a reflective personality, demonstrating low extraversion can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed (Stubblebine 2016). Having scored 56% I believe I sit in between here, having a mixture of being outgoing and energetic at times, but also being able to be reserved in other times and situations. 
A refers to the trait Agreeableness those with a high score tend to be friendly, compassionate, and cooperative. Indicates ones trusting and helpful nature, and whether one is well-tempered. However, those with a low  score tend to be analytic and detached tendency. Often competitive or challenging; is argumentative or untrustworthy (Stubblebine 2016). As I scored 62%, I believe this shows that I have tendency’s to be friendly and compassionate however as the score isn’t very high these traits are not a main standout of my personality.
N refers to the trait Neuroticism. People with a high score have tend to have high emotional reactiveness and vulnerability to stress. Neuroticism may correlate with perceiving many situations as threatening. Those with a low score tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. However, freedom from negative feelings does not necessarily mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings (Stubblebine 2016). As my score is evenly balanced with a score of 52%,  I believe my decision making based on emotions is not particularly strong or too weak and that I’m not easily stressed, but I am not immune to it either.


# How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

I believe my results from the Myers-Briggs test show that I’m easy to get along with and am very understanding of others. However, this test also showed that I like  to work individually so I’ll need to keep in mind to not try and take over other people’s ideas and let everyone contribute evenly. 
The results of the Big 5 personality test shows that I’m emotionally balanced, so I think this will help me in a group. I won’t view everyone’s ideas as in competition with my own and will use common sense to choose the best ideas for the outcome for the group. My results also showed that I’m open to new experiences too, if someone has an idea outside of the box, I won’t necessarily be the person to shut the idea down. 


# How should you take this into account when forming a team? 

I should try and form a team with people who have similar traits to those that I have. This will help the group be conflict free, as if I’m with other people who are opened minded  the ideas will flow,  group members will be slow to unfounded criticism. This will allow a variety of imaginative ideas to flow, this is important if you want to find new ways to solve problems.  However, if I join a group with strongly opinionated people who aren’t open to new ideas, this team will not function efficiently because time is taken up with people all wanting control; i.e. not wanting to let go of ideas no matter how good others are. 


# Project Idea
## Overview

I have chosen to make an app that will help pet owners locate their pets when they have run away. This app will also be beneficial for people who have a large property with lots of animals  and need to locate a specific animal for a VET check-up, or some such.  This will help take the stress out of many households, as when you call your beloved pets name and they are nowhere to be found, this app will help you be reunited with your fluffy family member in no time. This app will be made available for android and Apple devices. 


# Motivation

My motivation for creating this app is the 137,391 pets were found by the RSPCA between 2015 and 2016, with 22,000 not being reunited with their owners (RSPCA 2016). This means each year more than 22,000 Australians are left looking for their pet having no idea where they may be. Personally, having a serial runaway dog, I know the stress it can cause a family when one of your fury family members is out missing. This app will help owners track down the dog, like you track your phone when its lost. The app will make the event of losing a pet less stressful, for the pet and the family.

# Description

The app called “Find my fury Friend” will cost $25 AUD. It will be available on Apple and android devices. The price of the app will cover the expenses of production, as well on signing up the customer to the app, it will ask for address details, This is so a collar with pets name and GPS details with alarm can be shipped world wide to the customer to attach to their pets collar. For any additional pets you pay $15 AUD to get an additional GPS name collar. Each customer will have a username  (email address) as well as a password to login to the app. Once a customer is logged into the app, they can set up their animals with their own tracking device each. A customer can have up to a maximum of 300 animals on there account. This is to cater for farmers with large amounts of livestock, or researchers trying to keep tabs on animals. Allocating a GPS to an animal is easy, as you attach the GPS name tag on the animal. 
”Find my Fury Friend” is set up by the user. Once the device is turned on, click on the tab on the app home page and “add new animal”. A box will then appear to put in the unique code that is on the unique animal’s GPS device. The app will then prompt you to put in the pet’s name that GPS belongs to. You can also add a photo of that animal, once this is done you will hit the complete button. The device will then connect to the GPS tag and notify you that your device  has successfully paired with your animals GPS tag. When your animals batteries are getting low in the GPS device a message will be sent to your phone/ tablet which will tell you that you need to replace the batteries so there is no worries that the device will be flat when you most need it. Locating your pet is very easy as it’s as simple as clicking on the find my pet icon on the app home screen where you will be given an option of what pet you want to find with a photo of them next to there name after you have clicked on the pet you want to locate you will be given a map which will pinpoint your dog’s position on a map. The GPS device that is on the dog has a alarm on it so if you get to the location and its dark and you cant locate your pet you can press the  alarm icon on the top corner of the map which will set off a alarm which will  make it easier to find your pet.

# Tools and Technologies

The software I would need to make the app “Find My Fury Friend” is the MIT app inventor; this will allow me to create all the software needed to run my app for both android and Apple products. I will also need to source reliable GPS trackers that are small enough to put on the dog tags and that have built in alarms. Or, I could get trackers specially built through offshore companies like Alibaba. I would also need to make sure these GPS trackers would be compatible with the software on the app. 

# Skills Required

To be successful in making this app, I would need to learn how to navigate and use the MIT app inventor. Alternatively,  I could pay someone who is skilled in MIT. I believe it would be easy to find someone who is able to write this software for the app, as it is a popular app building application. However, I would also need to make sure this person was familiar with setting up apps with attached hardware like a GPS tracker, but this shouldn’t be very complicated for someone who specialises in writing app software. 

# Outcome

If this project is successful there will be many more lost pets that end up getting reunited with their families after they run away. This “Find my Fury Friend” will give all pet owners peace of mind when it comes to the pet that does sneak away without the owner knowing.  Peace of mind for the app user is only a few simple taps away on a smart device to find their beloved family member again.
