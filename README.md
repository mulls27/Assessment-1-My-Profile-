# About me

Hi, my name is Kristian Muller, I am an Australian citizen of Irish and Swedish heritage. My education to date has been basic, having only completed my SACE as well as a Certificate III in Sports and Recreation. Something interesting about me is that I’m very tall. I stand at two hundred centimetres. My favourite hobby is playing football on the weekends and going to the driving range to smack a couple of golf balls.

# Interest in IT

## What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My interest in IT is functional; it is in a variety of software and hardware that can make the supply chain increasingly efficient for businesses to manage. I have always had an interest in IT, but recently this has developed into a specific interest in software that contributes to supply chain management effectiveness for firms like  WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new interest has come about since the warehouse I work in part time has moved from using paper-based inventory control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart from using the basics in the Microsoft suite and beginning to use RF scanners at work to control inventory. However, I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

# Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT as it was the only university at the time that offered an online degree in business and logistics. I have worked in logistics since leaving school 5 years ago. RMIT online appealed to me, as I’m able to juggle working part time and studying full time.

# What do you expect to learn during your studies?

During this semester, in Introduction to Information Technology, I expect to learn the foundational aspects of using information technologies and to gain information about new, contemporary soft- and hard-ware.

# A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.

The primary role of this job is to help staff and students with any IT queries they may have. Another role of this job is to help maintain and improve current services that the Department of Information Technology provide to the University. I find this position appealing, as I like being given a problem to solve and fix it. I also enjoying helping people. 

# A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.

To be competitive to gain this job, you will need a diploma level qualification in Information Technology,  or an equivalent level of knowledge gained through on the job training and experience, or a mixture of both. As this job is service oriented - supporting students and staff most of the time -previous experience in dealing with customers would be a good advantage, as this demonstrates the ability to provide customer service.  As well, being able to show previous problem-solving skills will be an advantage, as this job will be heavily based on people bringing you IT problems to be solved.

# A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.

I don’t have the IT certifications required to fill this position, however having worked in logistics dealing with problem solving for customers all day;  I would be able to satisfy the customer service component as well as the problem-solving component. Working in logistics requires problem solving someone’s freight/ supply chain problems all day. I do have some practical experience in using programs specific to logistics and believe I could, with training, acquire skills on the job.

# A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.

To become competitive to gain this job, I think the most important thing I could do is to start a Diploma of Information Technology. I would begin this process by enrolling in ICT50118 (Diploma of Information Technology) at TAFE. I would choose this Diploma as it is nationally recognised by the Australian Institute of ICT. Also, this Diploma is available to study online which would give me flexibility with work. I would also try and gain an entry level part-time job in the Information Technology sector. I believe a mixture of the study and on the job training and experience will hold me in good contention to be considered for hiring by Charles Sturt University as their Information Technology Support Officer.
